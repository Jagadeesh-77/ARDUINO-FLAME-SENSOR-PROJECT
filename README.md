# ARDUINO-FLAME-SENSOR-PROJECT
Flame sensor module has a photodiode to detect the light and an op-amp to control the sensitivity. It is used to detect fire and provide a HIGH signal upon the detection. Arduino reads the signal and provides alert by turning on the buzzer and LED. The flame sensor used here is an IR based flame sensor.
